"xkbset-gui" for enabling keyboard pointer as the very first step
#Hold Shift and press Num-Lock to enable keyboard mouse emulation
To move the mouse pointer:

    7, 8 ,9 are the up directions
    4, 6 are left and right
    1, 2, 3 are the down directions

Clicking using the emulated mouse buttons is slightly tricky and you have to learn the trick:

    / selects the left mouse key (press it twice for a doubleclick; and thrice for a tripleclick)
    * selects the middle mouse key
    - selects the right mouse key

Do note that / and * and - will only select and make a mouse button active. To actually use the active mouse button you need to press:

    Press 5 or + do to the actual mouse-click
    Press 0 / Ins to press and hold the selected mouse key (e.g. for dragging something)
    Press . / Del to release the currently selected mouse key.

The numpad emulated mouse is easy to use if you get used to first selecting the mouse key you want to (ab)use by pressing / for left mouse key, - for the right botton or * for the middle and then pressing 5 to do the actual click (or Ins/Del for drag-and-drop).

Example: To do a mouse-click with the middle button you first press the * key and then 5 to click.
